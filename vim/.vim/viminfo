	Docstring for torch.nn.modules.loss:class CrossEntropyLoss
	==========================================================
	CrossEntropyLoss(weight: Optional[Any]=..., ignore_index: int=..., reduction: str=...)
	
	This criterion combines :func:`nn.LogSoftmax` and :func:`nn.NLLLoss` in one single class.
	
	It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
	If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
	assigning weight to each of the classes.
	This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.
	
	The `input` is expected to contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class.
	
	`input` has to be a Tensor of size either :math:`(minibatch, C)` or
	:math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
	with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).
	
	This criterion expects a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]` as the
	`target` for each value of a 1D tensor of size `minibatch`; if `ignore_index`
	is specified, this criterion also accepts this class index (this index may not
	necessarily be in the class range).
	
	The loss can be described as:
	
	.. math::
	    \text{loss}(x, class) = -\log\left(\frac{\exp(x[class])}{\sum_j \exp(x[j])}\right)
	                   = -x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)
	
	or in the case of the :attr:`weight` argument being specified:
	
	.. math::
	    \text{loss}(x, class) = weight[class] \left(-x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)\right)
	
	The losses are averaged across observations for each minibatch.
	
	Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
	an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
	where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
	(see below).
	
	
	Args:
	    weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
	        If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
	    size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
	        the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
	        some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
	        is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
	        when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
	    ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored

	Docstring for torch.nn.modules.loss:class CTCLoss
	=================================================
	CTCLoss(blank: int=..., reduction: str=..., zero_infinity: bool=...)
	
	The Connectionist Temporal Classification loss.
	
	Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence. CTCLoss sums over the
	probability of possible alignments of input to target, producing a loss value which is differentiable
	with respect to each input node. The alignment of input to target is assumed to be "many-to-one", which
	limits the length of the target sequence such that it must be :math:`\leq` the input length.
	
	Args:
	    blank (int, optional): blank label. Default :math:`0`.
	    reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
	        ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,

	================================================================
	DataParallel(module: Module[T_co], device_ids: Optional[_devices_t]=..., output_device: Optional[_device_t]=..., dim: int=...)
	
	Implements data parallelism at the module level.
	
	This container parallelizes the application of the given :attr:`module` by
	splitting the input across the specified devices by chunking in the batch
	dimension (other objects will be copied once per device). In the forward
	pass, the module is replicated on each device, and each replica handles a
	portion of the input. During the backwards pass, gradients from each replica
	are summed into the original module.
	
	The batch size should be larger than the number of GPUs used.
	
	See also: :ref:`cuda-nn-dataparallel-instead`
	
	Arbitrary positional and keyword inputs are allowed to be passed into
	DataParallel but some types are specially handled. tensors will be
	**scattered** on dim specified (default 0). tuple, list and dict types will
	be shallow copied. The other types will be shared among different threads
	and can be corrupted if written to in the model's forward pass.
	
	The parallelized :attr:`module` must have its parameters and buffers on
	``device_ids[0]`` before running this :class:`~torch.nn.DataParallel`
	module.
	
	.. warning::
	    In each forward, :attr:`module` is **replicated** on each device, so any
	    updates to the running module in ``forward`` will be lost. For example,
	    if :attr:`module` has a counter attribute that is incremented in each
	    ``forward``, it will always stay at the initial value because the update
	    is done on the replicas which are destroyed after ``forward``. However,
	    :class:`~torch.nn.DataParallel` guarantees that the replica on
	    ``device[0]`` will have its parameters and buffers sharing storage with
	    the base parallelized :attr:`module`. So **in-place** updates to the
	    parameters or buffers on ``device[0]`` will be recorded. E.g.,
	    :class:`~torch.nn.BatchNorm2d` and :func:`~torch.nn.utils.spectral_norm`
	    rely on this behavior to update the buffers.
	
	.. warning::
	    Forward and backward hooks defined on :attr:`module` and its submodules
	    will be invoked ``len(device_ids)`` times, each with inputs located on
	    a particular device. Particularly, the hooks are only guaranteed to be
	    executed in correct order with respect to operations on corresponding
	    devices. For example, it is not guaranteed that hooks set via
	    :meth:`~torch.nn.Module.register_forward_pre_hook` be executed before
	    `all` ``len(device_ids)`` :meth:`~torch.nn.Module.forward` calls, but
	    that each such hook be executed before the corresponding
	    :meth:`~torch.nn.Module.forward` call of that device.
